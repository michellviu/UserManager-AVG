# UserManager-AVG
Repository intended to perform a user management API in .NET.

The requirements will be as follows:
1. Fast-endpoint
2. Fluent validation
3. EntityFramework Core.
4. Mapperly
5. Xunit/AutoFixture/AutoMock
6. Postman to test API endpoints
7. Security with Jwt
8. Correct logging of actions in the system

So far, there are endpoints for login, registration, listing, updating and deleting users, the latter two being restricted only to admin roles.

Admin    
UserName: admin  
Password: Admin@123
